##The Online Vehicle Parking Reservation System (OVPRS) is a system that enables 
customers/drivers to reserve a parking space. It also allows the customers/drivers to view the
parking status at kyebando people’s park. It was developed because the congestion and collision 
of the vehicle, the system was developed for Kyebando People’s Park located in Kyebando
Therefore the project aimed at solving such problems by designing a web based system that will 
enable the customers/drivers to make a reservation of available parking space at people’s park.
The requirements for the developed system were collected using observation and interviewing the 
customer and staff member from Kyebando people’s park. The data from interviews was analyzed 
using Microsoft Excel so as to come up with the functional, non- functional and system 
requirements. These requirements were later used to design the system by creating data flow 
diagrams and entity relationship diagrams. The designed system was implemented using different 
development tools which include HTML for creating interfaces, CSS for styling wed pages 
,JavaScript, and Jquery for dynamism in the web pages and as an input validation tool.XAMMP 
was used to build the database and PHP used as a server side scripting language to connect the 
user interfaces to the database. The system was tested by the researchers for errors
