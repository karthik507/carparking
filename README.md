The Online Vehicle Parking Reservation System (OVPRS) is a system that enables 
customers/drivers to reserve a parking space. It also allows the customers/drivers to view the
parking status at specific location. It was developed because the congestion and collision 
of the vehicle, so we developed this system.
Therefore the project aimed at solving such problems by designing a web based system that will 
enable the customers/drivers to make a reservation of available parking space.
The designed system was implemented using different development tools which include HTML 
for creating interfaces, CSS for styling wed pages ,JavaScript, and Jquery for dynamism 
in the web pages and as an input validation tool.XAMMP was used to build the database and 
PHP used as a server side scripting language to connect the user interfaces to the database.
